title: HULLBREACH

# HULLBREACH

## Design Prompt

HULLBREACH is a rules-light roleplaying game inspired by **MÖRK BORG** and **Cepheus Engine**, but reskinned for a sci-fi setting:  
Players take the role of **heavily armoured, bioengineered space marines** exploring derelict ships in a **spaceship graveyard**, battling alien horrors.

Core themes:

- **Tense exploration** of claustrophobic starship corridors.
- **Resource management** (ammo, gear, supplies, power cells).
- **Risk/reward** (push deeper for better salvage, at higher danger).
- **Over-the-top violence** with heavy weapons, flamers, grenades, chainblades.
- **Malfunctions** that are as funny as they are dangerous.
- **Marines and their power armour** can survive terrible wounds through nanites, cybernetics, and onboard AIs.
- **Gear-driven progression**: equipment defines actions; carrying capacity & Rank limit choices.

The game must remain **rules-light**: few mechanics, lots of dice rolled, quick but brutal combat and comedy.

---

## Ideas to Implement

- **Malfunction tables by gear type** (starting with projectile, melee, and special weapons).
- **Medical treatments**: replacement limbs, organs, and even heads (cybernetic or vat-grown).  
- **Advantages and flaws** tied to replacement parts, with better options at higher Rank.  
- **Onboard AI control** when a marine is unconscious (reduced capability but not out of play).  
- **Task HP system** for hacking, cutting, and repairs under fire.  
- **Tiers of Gear** tied to Rank progression.  
- **Promotion system** for advancing Rank.  
- **Combat Zones & Movement mechanics** — revisit to refine tactical depth.

## Character Creation

### Generate Attributes & Starting Rank

Each character has four attributes (range –3 to +3). Roll **1d6** to see how many points you can spend **and to determine your starting Rank**.

| d6  | Points   | Starting Rank        |
|-----|----------|----------------------|
| 1–2 | 4 points | Specialist (Rank 2)  |
| 3–5 | 5 points | Trooper (Rank 1)     |
| 6   | 6 points | Trooper (Rank 1)     |

The attributes are as follows:

| Attribute  | Description                                |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Reflex** | Dodging, aiming, piloting                  |
| **Tech**   | Hacking, sensors, demolitions, interfacing |
| **Might**  | Melee, breaching, raw strength             |
| **Grit**   | Endurance, survival, pain threshold        |

The cost for assigning points is as follows:
 
| Modifier | Cost        |
|----------|-------------|
| –3       | –3 (refund) |
| –2       | –2 (refund) |
| –1       | –1 (refund) |
| 0        | Free        |
| +1       | 1           |
| +2       | 3           |
| +3       | 5           |

No stat may start higher than +3 or lower than –3.

### Roll Hit Points

Base HP now comes from your **armour model** (see Armour section), plus your **Grit** score.  

### Choose Armour

Select one of the available **Armour Models**. This defines your starting **Base HP, Carry Capacity, Movement, Damage Reduction, and Attribute bonuses**.  

### Choose Gear

   - Take basic survival kit (rations, oxygen, comms).
   - Roll or pick starting weapons, armor, and tools (see Gear section).
   - You may only carry items up to your **Armour’s Carry Capacity** without penalty.

### Define Your Marine

   - Give a name, callsign, or designation.
   - Your starting **Rank** is determined above. Higher Ranks will be earned through promotion.
   - Optionally, roll on background/flaw tables (to be added).

Then you’re ready for your first mission.

---

## Armour

At character creation, choose one of the following **Armour Models**.  
Your armour defines your **Base HP, Carry Capacity, Movement difficulty, Damage Reduction, and Attribute bonuses**.  

| Armour Model              | Base HP | Carry Capacity | Move DR | DRR | Bonus | Notes |
|----------------------------|---------|----------------|---------|-----|-------|-------|
| **Revenant Lightframe**    | 10      | Might + 6      | DR 6    | 1   | +1 Reflex | Recon suit: agile and quiet, ideal for scouts. |
| **Bastion Carapace**       | 11      | Might + 10     | DR 8    | 2   | +1 Might  | Standard-issue heavy infantry shell. Balanced. |
| **Vindicator Assault Harness** | 12  | Might + 12     | DR 10   | 2   | +2 Might  | Power-assisted brute force armour for breachers. |
| **Wraith Pattern Exo**     | 10      | Might + 8      | DR 6    | 1   | +1 Reflex, +1 Tech | Stealth and recon rig with sensor uplinks. |
| **Juggernaut Siege Frame** | 13      | Might + 14     | DR 12   | 3   | +2 Grit   | Walking bunker, built to soak up incoming fire. |
| **Aegis Guardian Plate**   | 11      | Might + 10     | DR 8    | 2   | +1 Reflex, +1 Grit | Defensive armour with stabilizers and AI-assisted reflexes. |

### Movement Check

- To move **1 zone**, make a **Reflex test vs your armour’s Move DR**.  
- Each **success = 1 zone moved** (max 2 zones per action).  
- **Failure = no movement** — you stumble, snag, or your armour slows you.  
- **Critical (3+ successes):** move 3 zones in a burst of speed.  
- **Complication (all 1s):** your armour makes a loud clang, vents sparks, or trips — roll on the Noise/Attention Table (to be written).  

---

## Core Rules

### Resolution Mechanic

All tests are made using **gear**, not abstract skills. Every weapon, tool, or system has a **Skill Rating** and a **Malfunction Rating**.

1. **Build the Dice Pool**  
   - Roll a number of **d6 = Attribute + Gear Skill Rating**.  
   - Minimum: 1 die is always rolled.  

2. **Count Successes**  
   - Each roll of **5 or 6 = 1 success**.  
   - **1 success** = task completed (or 1 point of damage).  
   - More successes = stronger outcome, faster completion, or additional damage.  

3. **Weapons & Damage**  
   - Each success = 1 damage (unless weapon says otherwise).  
   - Targets reduce incoming damage by armor.  

4. **Task HP**  
   - Some challenges have HP that must be reduced to 0 (e.g. hacking a computer, cutting through a bulkhead, repairing a reactor).  
   - Each success rolled reduces the Task HP by 1.  
   - Each roll represents about one round of time under pressure.  

5. **Malfunctions**  
   - Each item has a **Malfunction Rating (MR)**.  
   - If you roll that many **1s** in a single test, a malfunction occurs.  
   - If you roll fewer dice than the MR, a malfunction only occurs if **all dice are 1s**.  
   - Malfunctions occur even if the test succeeds.  
   - Roll on the relevant **Malfunction Table**.  

---

## Carrying Capacity

Carry up to **Might + 8 items**.
- Exceeding this adds +2 dice difficulty (reduce successes by 1 for each test).
- Cannot exceed double capacity.

---

## Hit Points (HP)

- Start with **Grit + d8** HP (minimum 1).
- At **0 HP**: you are **Broken**.
- At negative HP: dead — unless your armour, nanites, or AI keep you going.

**Broken (d4):**

1. Unconscious for d4 rounds, AI takes partial control.  
2. Crippled (lose arm/eye/leg), AI keeps you functional.  
3. Bleeding out: death in d2 hours unless treated; nanites slow the process.  
4. Decapitated — but your suit keeps fighting until help arrives.  

---

## Rank

Ranks measure your experience and seniority within **HULLBREACH**.  
They unlock access to better equipment and privileges on the battlefield.

- **Trooper (Rank 1)** — Standard recruits. Access to Tier-1 gear.  
- **Specialist (Rank 2)** — Trusted operators. Access to Tier-1 and Tier-2 gear.  
- **Sergeant (Rank 3)** — Veteran leaders. Access to Tier-1 through Tier-3 gear.  
- **Lieutenant (Rank 4)** — Elite marines. Access to all four gear tiers.  

### Gear Tiers (Placeholder)

Gear is divided into four tiers. Each Rank unlocks higher tiers, with the most advanced weapons and equipment restricted to veterans. (Gear lists to come.)

### Promotion (Placeholder)

After completing missions, marines may be promoted to higher ranks. The process for promotion will be detailed later.

---

## Fire Modes

- **Full Auto** — Add +2 SR to the attack. Must reload immediately after firing.  
- **Burst** — May split damage across multiple targets in a 120° arc in the same zone.  
- **Suppression** — Targeted enemies’ movement is halved.  
- **Full Suppression** — Targets are pinned; cannot move this round. Requires reload afterwards.  

---

## Weapon Traits

- **Unreliable** — In Burst or Suppression, MR worsens by –1.  
- **Armor-Piercing** — Ignores 1 tier of armor (or all armor for advanced/prototype weapons).  
- **Shredding** — Targets struck without armor must make a morale check.  
- **Tracer** — Allies firing at the same target this round gain +1 die.  
- **Brutal** — On a crit (multiple 6s), deal +1 damage beyond normal.  
- **Stable Mount** — If braced (mounted, prone, bipod), gain +1 SR.  
- **Silent** — Does not trigger automatic Reaction checks.  
- **Overheat** — Cannot fire in Full Auto two turns in a row without a malfunction check.  

---

## Reloading

Reloading is a tense, risky process:

- **Takes an action.**  
- Make a **Reflex test using the weapon’s Skill Rating**.  
- You must roll a number of successes equal to the weapon’s **Reload Rating**.  
- If you succeed, the weapon is reloaded.  
- If you fail, the reload is incomplete, but progress is kept (Reload HP).  
- Some gear makes this process easier (see Reload Gear).

*Note: Each gear type in HULLBREACH has its own malfunction table. More will be added for scanners, hacking tools, armor systems, etc.*# HULLBREACH

## Design Prompt

HULLBREACH is a rules-light roleplaying game inspired by **MÖRK BORG** and **Cepheus Engine**, but reskinned for a sci-fi setting:  
Players take the role of **heavily armoured, bioengineered space marines** exploring derelict ships in a **spaceship graveyard**, battling alien horrors.

## Core Rules

### Resolution Mechanic

All tests are made using **gear**, not abstract skills. Every weapon, tool, or system has a **Skill Rating** and a **Malfunction Rating**.

1. **Build the Dice Pool**  
   - Roll a number of **d6 = Attribute + Gear Skill Rating**.  
   - Minimum: 1 die is always rolled.  

2. **Count Successes**  
   - Each roll of **5 or 6 = 1 success**.  
   - **1 success** = task completed (or 1 point of damage).  
   - More successes = stronger outcome, faster completion, or additional damage.  

3. **Weapons & Damage**  
   - Each success = 1 damage (unless weapon says otherwise).  
   - Targets reduce incoming damage by armor.  

4. **Task HP**  
   - Some challenges have HP that must be reduced to 0 (e.g. hacking a computer, cutting through a bulkhead, repairing a reactor).  
   - Each success rolled reduces the Task HP by 1.  
   - Each roll represents about one round of time under pressure.  

5. **Malfunctions**  
   - Each item has a **Malfunction Rating (MR)**.  
   - If you roll that many **1s** in a single test, a malfunction occurs.  
   - If you roll fewer dice than the MR, a malfunction only occurs if **all dice are 1s**.  
   - Malfunctions occur even if the test succeeds.  
   - Roll on the relevant **Malfunction Table**.  

---

## Carrying Capacity

Carry up to **Might + 8 items**.
- Exceeding this adds +2 dice difficulty (reduce successes by 1 for each test).
- Cannot exceed double capacity.

---

## Hit Points (HP)

- Start with **Grit + d8** HP (minimum 1).
- At **0 HP**: you are **Broken**.
- At negative HP: dead — unless your armour, nanites, or AI keep you going.

**Broken (d4):**

1. Unconscious for d4 rounds, AI takes partial control.  
2. Crippled (lose arm/eye/leg), AI keeps you functional.  
3. Bleeding out: death in d2 hours unless treated; nanites slow the process.  
4. Decapitated — but your suit keeps fighting until help arrives.  

---

## Rank

Ranks measure your experience and seniority within **HULLBREACH**.  
They unlock access to better equipment and privileges on the battlefield.

- **Trooper (Rank 1)** — Standard recruits. Access to Tier-1 gear.  
- **Specialist (Rank 2)** — Trusted operators. Access to Tier-1 and Tier-2 gear.  
- **Sergeant (Rank 3)** — Veteran leaders. Access to Tier-1 through Tier-3 gear.  
- **Lieutenant (Rank 4)** — Elite marines. Access to all four gear tiers.  

### Gear Tiers (Placeholder)

Gear is divided into four tiers. Each Rank unlocks higher tiers, with the most advanced weapons and equipment restricted to veterans. (Gear lists to come.)

### Promotion (Placeholder)

After completing missions, marines may be promoted to higher ranks. The process for promotion will be detailed later.

---

## Fire Modes

- **Full Auto** — Add +2 SR to the attack. Must reload immediately after firing.  
- **Burst** — May split damage across multiple targets in a 120° arc in the same zone.  
- **Suppression** — Targeted enemies’ movement is halved.  
- **Full Suppression** — Targets are pinned; cannot move this round. Requires reload afterwards.  

---

## Weapon Traits

- **Unreliable** — In Burst or Suppression, MR worsens by –1.  
- **Armor-Piercing** — Ignores 1 tier of armor (or all armor for advanced/prototype weapons).  
- **Shredding** — Targets struck without armor must make a morale check.  
- **Tracer** — Allies firing at the same target this round gain +1 die.  
- **Brutal** — On a crit (multiple 6s), deal +1 damage beyond normal.  
- **Stable Mount** — If braced (mounted, prone, bipod), gain +1 SR.  
- **Silent** — Does not trigger automatic Reaction checks.  
- **Overheat** — Cannot fire in Full Auto two turns in a row without a malfunction check.  

---

## Reloading

Reloading is a tense, risky process:

- **Takes an action.**  
- Make a **Reflex test using the weapon’s Skill Rating**.  
- You must roll a number of successes equal to the weapon’s **Reload Rating**.  
- If you succeed, the weapon is reloaded.  
- If you fail, the reload is incomplete, but progress is kept (Reload HP).  
- Some gear makes this process easier (see Reload Gear).

| d6 | Malfunction |
|----|-------------|
| 1   | **Accidental Ammo Ejection.** Mag or shells spill out. Weapon is empty and must be reloaded. |
| 2   | **Jam (2).** Weapon locks. Requires a **Tech test using the weapon’s SR**, needing **2 successes** to clear. Until cleared, weapon cannot fire. |
