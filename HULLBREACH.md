# HULLBREACH

## Design Prompt

HULLBREACH is a rules-light roleplaying game inspired by **MÖRK BORG** and **Cepheus Engine**, but reskinned for a sci-fi setting:  
Players take the role of **heavily armoured, bioengineered space marines** exploring derelict ships in a **spaceship graveyard**, battling alien horrors.

Core themes:

- **Tense exploration** of claustrophobic starship corridors.
- **Resource management** (ammo, gear, supplies, power cells).
- **Risk/reward** (push deeper for better salvage, at higher danger).
- **Over-the-top violence** with heavy weapons, flamers, grenades, chainblades.
- **Malfunctions** that are as funny as they are dangerous.
- **Marines and their power armour** can survive terrible wounds through nanites, cybernetics, and onboard AIs.
- **Gear-driven progression**: equipment defines actions; carrying capacity & Rank limit choices.

The game must remain **rules-light**: few mechanics, lots of dice rolled, quick but brutal combat and comedy.

---

## Ideas to Implement

- **Malfunction tables by gear type** (projectile, melee, special weapons, utility gear, armor systems).  
- **Medical treatments**: replacement limbs, organs, and even heads (cybernetic or vat-grown).  
- **Advantages and flaws** tied to replacement parts, with better options at higher Rank.  
- **Onboard AI control** when a marine is unconscious (reduced capability but not out of play).  
- **Task HP system** for hacking, cutting, and repairs under fire.  
- **Tiers of Gear** tied to Rank progression.  
- **Promotion system** for advancing Rank.  
- **Combat Zones & Movement mechanics** — revisit to refine tactical depth.  
- **Explosives & Grenades system.**  
- **Panic/Tension tracker system.**  
- **Combat Drugs system.**  
- **SOPMODs for social/knowledge skills.**  
- **Expanded Initiative system.**  
- **Surprise rules.**  
- **Scanner rules + malfunction table.**  
- **Expanded Stealth rules.**  
- **Panicked Action Table.**  
- **Exploration system for derelicts (doors, bulkheads, hazards).**  
- **Blips (alien enemies) bestiary.**  
- **Introductory Scenario.**

## Character Creation

### Generate Attributes & Starting Rank

Each character has four attributes (range –3 to +3). Roll **1d6** to see how many points you can spend **and to determine your starting Rank**.

| d6  | Points   | Starting Rank        |
|-----|----------|----------------------|
| 1–2 | 4 points | Specialist (Rank 2)  |
| 3–5 | 5 points | Trooper (Rank 1)     |
| 6   | 6 points | Trooper (Rank 1)     |

The attributes are as follows:

| Attribute  | Description                                |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Reflex** | Dodging, aiming, piloting                  |
| **Tech**   | Hacking, sensors, demolitions, interfacing |
| **Might**  | Melee, breaching, raw strength             |
| **Grit**   | Endurance, survival, pain threshold        |

The cost for assigning points is as follows:
 
| Modifier | Cost        |
|----------|-------------|
| –3       | –3 (refund) |
| –2       | –2 (refund) |
| –1       | –1 (refund) |
| 0        | Free        |
| +1       | 1           |
| +2       | 3           |
| +3       | 5           |

No stat may start higher than +3 or lower than –3.

### Roll Hit Points

Base HP now comes from your **armour model** (see Armour section), plus your **Grit** score.  

### Choose Armour

Select one of the available **Armour Models**. This defines your starting **Base HP, Carry Capacity, Movement, Damage Reduction, Wound Threshold, and Attribute bonuses**.  

### Choose Gear

   - Take basic survival kit (rations, oxygen, comms).
   - Roll or pick starting weapons, armor, and tools (see Gear section).
   - You may only carry items up to your **Armour’s Carry Capacity** without penalty.

### Define Your Marine

   - Give a name, callsign, or designation.
   - Your starting **Rank** is determined above. Higher Ranks will be earned through promotion.
   - Optionally, roll on background/flaw tables (to be added).

Then you’re ready for your first mission.

---

## Armour

*(Armour table with Base HP, DRR, WT, Move DR — unchanged from last draft)*

### Movement Check

- To move **1 zone**, make a **Reflex test vs your armour’s Move DR**.  
- Each **success = 1 zone moved** (max 2 zones per action).  
- **Failure = no movement** — you stumble, snag, or your armour slows you.  
- **Critical (3+ successes):** move 3 zones in a burst of speed.  
- **Complication (all 1s):** your armour makes a loud clang, vents sparks, or trips — roll on the Noise/Attention Table (to be written).  

---

## 💥 Damage & Wounds

- **Damage** reduces your armour’s **HP** after applying Damage Reduction (DRR).  
- At **0 HP**, your **suit is destroyed** — it no longer provides DRR or movement bonuses, but you may fight on if you survive wounds.  
- **Wound Threshold (WT):** Any single attack that deals ≥ WT damage causes a **Wound** to the marine inside the armour.  
- Wounds bypass armour and affect the **body** (limbs, organs, senses).  

---

## ⚡ Wounds Table (d20)

Whenever a Wound is inflicted, roll d20. Effects stack.  

| d20 | Wound |
|-----|-------|
| 1   | **Bruised Ribs.** Wind knocked out. –1 Reflex until end of mission. |
| 2   | **Fractured Hand.** Drop whatever you’re holding. Using 2H weapons adds +1 DR to all rolls. |
| 3   | **Shattered Foot.** Movement hobbled. Move DR +2. |
| 4   | **Eye Trauma.** Vision blurred or one eye lost. –1 die on ranged attacks. |
| 5   | **Ear Rupture.** Deaf on one side. Surprise attacks from that flank gain +1 die. |
| 6   | **Broken Arm.** Can’t use that arm. Drop items, 2H weapons impossible. |
| 7   | **Shoulder Dislocation.** –1 Might until repaired. |
| 8   | **Gut Puncture.** Bleeding internally. Take d3 Grit damage immediately. |
| 9   | **Collapsed Lung.** Breathing assisted by suit. –1 Grit until cybernetic/vat replacement. |
| 10  | **Cracked Spine.** Neural feedback. –1 Tech and Reflex. |
| 11  | **Severed Hand.** Lose hand; can’t use 2H gear. Must be replaced. |
| 12  | **Crushed Leg.** Can’t sprint. Move limited to 1 zone max. |
| 13  | **Severed Arm.** –2 Might. All gear in that hand lost. |
| 14  | **Severed Leg.** Move DR increases by +4, sprinting impossible. |
| 15  | **Severe Internal Trauma.** Suit’s nanites keep you alive, but you take d6 Grit damage. |
| 16  | **Organ Loss.** Kidney, spleen, liver, or equivalent. Immediate med treatment required or die at mission end. |
| 17  | **Massive Head Trauma.** Suit AI takes partial control. –2 Reflex and Tech until replaced (cybernetic or vat head). |
| 18  | **Catastrophic Bleed.** Artery ruptured. Lose d3 HP at end of each round until treated. |
| 19  | **Decapitation (Partial).** Head severed or crushed — but suit AI puppets the body for d3 rounds. Afterwards: dead without replacement. |
| 20  | **Fatal Core Damage.** Heart or brain destroyed. Nanites keep you alive for 1 round. If not treated immediately (Med Task HP 3), you die. |

---

## 🧬 Medical Treatment

Marines of the HULLBREACH Corps are designed to survive injuries that would instantly kill ordinary humans. Stabilizing nanites, automated suit systems, and battlefield medicine can keep them alive — but wounds often require cybernetics or vat-grown replacements.  

### Stabilization (in the field)

- **Broken Marines** or those suffering severe **Wounds** must be stabilized to avoid death.  
- Stabilization requires appropriate **Medical Gear** (Medi-Pack, Field Surgery Kit, Nanite Injector, etc.).  
- Each item has a **Task HP** cost depending on severity:  
  - Minor Wound: Task HP 1  
  - Major Wound (limb loss, organ failure): Task HP 2  
  - Critical Wound (head trauma, decapitation, heart/lung): Task HP 3+  
- A **Tech test** is rolled with the medical gear’s **SR**. Each success reduces Task HP by 1.  

If Task HP is not reduced to 0 before the mission ends, the marine dies.

---

### Replacement & Recovery (between missions)

Destroyed or crippled body parts can be replaced with **cybernetics** or **vat-grown organs/limbs**.  
Higher Rank marines have access to higher-quality replacements.  

| Replacement Type   | Effect |
|--------------------|--------|
| **Basic Cybernetic** | Restores lost function, but roll on Flaw Table. |
| **Advanced Cybernetic** | Restores function and grants a minor bonus (+1 die to relevant tests). |
| **Vat-Grown Clone Part** | Identical replacement, no bonuses or flaws. Expensive. |
| **Experimental Graft** | Restores function and grants unique perk (infrared eye, servo arm, toxin-filter lung) — but unstable. Roll on Experimental Graft Table. |

---

### Post-Mission Recovery

At the end of a mission:  
- Roll **d6 for each Wound** you sustained.  
  - On 1–3: it requires replacement (cybernetic or vat).  
  - On 4–6: nanites + stasis pods repaired it. You recover without surgery.  
- HP is restored fully after downtime, but attribute penalties from lost parts remain until treated.  

---

### Death & Resurrection (optional rule)

Even death is not always the end. With enough **resources and Rank**, marines may be revived through:  
- **Cerebral Core Backup** (upload into a cloned or cybernetic body).  
- **Nanite Reanimation** (return to action, but permanently Flawed).  
- **AI Puppetry** (the marine’s suit AI runs their body indefinitely… personality optional).  

Each option carries heavy **costs and corruption risks**.  

---

## ⚡ Cybernetic Flaw Table (d20)

Roll whenever you receive a **basic cybernetic replacement** (limb, organ, sensory system). Higher-rank or advanced replacements may ignore this table.  

| d20 | Flaw |
|-----|------|
| 1   | **Glitch-Twitch.** Involuntary spasms. –1 die to Reflex tests requiring precision. |
| 2   | **Cold Grip.** Prosthetic hand lacks fine control. +1 DR to delicate tasks. |
| 3   | **Feedback Loop.** Occasional shocks. Take 1 damage after rolling a natural 1. |
| 4   | **Uncalibrated Optics.** Depth perception off. –1 die on ranged attacks. |
| 5   | **Phantom Pain.** Old nerves scream. Lose 1 action on a roll of triple 1s. |
| 6   | **Noise Bleed.** Audio implant picks up static. Surprise attacks gain +1 die against you. |
| 7   | **Drain Hog.** Cybernetics siphon suit power. Reduce Carry Capacity by –2. |
| 8   | **Overheats.** Implant runs hot. On long missions, take d2 damage unless cooled. |
| 9   | **Patchwork Code.** Tech tests suffer +1 DR when using hacking gear. |
| 10  | **Magnet Weakness.** Strong fields mess with you. On malfunction nearby, drop items in hand. |
| 11  | **Servo Lag.** Movements delayed. Initiative rolls suffer –1. |
| 12  | **Uncanny Face.** Vat-grown or synthetic features creep others out. NPC Reactions at –2. |
| 13  | **Nanite Addiction.** You require an injector every mission or lose 1 Grit. |
| 14  | **Horrible Scar Tissue.** –1 HP permanently. Looks metal as hell. |
| 15  | **AI Ghost.** Replacement part whispers in your dreams. Once per mission, it acts on its own. |
| 16  | **Obvious Mod.** Everyone knows you’re patched up. Enemies prioritize you in combat. |
| 17  | **Paranoid Subroutines.** You mistrust allies. Reaction rolls with squadmates are one step worse. |
| 18  | **Corrupted Nanites.** 1-in-6 chance per wound that healing attempts fail. |
| 19  | **Backdoor Code.** Someone else can override your implant remotely… and sometimes does. |
| 20  | **Reject Host.** Implant rejects your body. Take d3 damage after each mission until replaced/upgraded. |

---

## ⚡ Experimental Graft Table (d12)

Roll when a marine receives an unstable, prototype graft instead of a standard replacement. Each graft gives a **perk AND a flaw**.  

| d12 | Graft |
|-----|-------|
| 1 | **Infrared Eye.** See in darkness and through smoke. Flaw: bright lights blind you (–2 dice for 1 round). |
| 2 | **Servo Arm.** +1 Might and can crush steel. Flaw: unpredictable twitch — roll d6 each mission; on 1, it attacks nearest object/ally once. |
| 3 | **Toxin Filter Lung.** Immune to gas/poison. Flaw: requires daily nanite infusion or lose 1 Grit. |
| 4 | **Adrenal Node.** Once per mission, add +2 dice to any roll. Flaw: after use, lose d3 HP from burnout. |
| 5 | **Dermal Plating.** Gain +1 DRR. Flaw: skin stiff and pale. Stealth rolls at –1 die. |
| 6 | **Ossified Fist.** Can punch for Dmg 2, Armor-Piercing. Flaw: hand too stiff for fine tasks. Cannot use gear requiring SR > 1. |
| 7 | **Neural Overclocker.** +1 Tech. Flaw: on natural 1, take d3 damage from seizures. |
| 8 | **Spider Limbs.** Extra mechanical arms. Can wield 3rd weapon/tool. Flaw: +1 slot permanently used by the limbs. |
| 9 | **Tail-Spike.** Natural melee weapon (Dmg 2, Brutal). Flaw: +1 slot; enemies always notice you first. |
| 10 | **Vascular Nanite Mesh.** Once per mission, ignore a Wound result. Flaw: permanent corruption risk — roll d20 each mission; on 1, nanites revolt (take d6 damage). |
| 11 | **Overclocked Heart.** Initiative always succeeds in your favor. Flaw: after combat, roll d6; on 1, suffer heart failure (Broken). |
| 12 | **Hive Interface.** Can control up to 2 drones as if they were your own limbs. Flaw: alien whispers creep in — once per mission, GM may force you to act against squad goals for 1 round. |

## 🦾 Cybernetic & Vat Replacement Gear

| Item | Slots | SR | MR | Cost | Special |
|------|-------|----|----|------|---------|
| **Basic Cybernetic Limb** | 1 | 2 | 3 | 3 RP | Restores lost arm/leg. Roll on **Cybernetic Flaw Table**. |
| **Advanced Cybernetic Limb** | 1 | 3 | 2 | 5 RP | Restores function, +1 die on relevant checks (Might for arms, Reflex for legs). Immune to flaws. |
| **Vat-Grown Limb** | 1 | 2 | 4 | 4 RP | Perfect organic replacement. No flaws, but fragile (–1 DRR if targeted). |
| **Basic Sensory Implant** | 0.5 | 2 | 3 | 2 RP | Replaces eye or ear. Grants function back. Roll on **Cybernetic Flaw Table**. |
| **Advanced Sensory Implant** | 0.5 | 3 | 2 | 4 RP | Replaces eye/ear with enhancements (infrared, zoom, sonic filters). No flaws. |
| **Vat-Grown Organ** | 1 | 2 | 4 | 4 RP | Replaces kidney, lung, liver, etc. No flaws, but costly. |
| **Synthetic Organ** | 1 | 2 | 3 | 3 RP | Cybernetic replacement organ. Restores function but roll on **Cybernetic Flaw Table**. |
| **Experimental Graft** | 1–2 | 3 | 2 | 6 RP | Roll on **Experimental Graft Table** for perk + flaw. |
| **Nanite Core** | 1 | 2 | 2 | 5 RP | Colony of stabilizing nanites permanently grafted in. Once per mission, auto-stabilize a Wound. Risk of corruption. |
| **Cerebral Backup Implant** | 1 | 2 | 2 | 8 RP | Stores a snapshot of your brain. On death, transfer to clone/cyber body (GM discretion). |

## Core Rules

### Resolution Mechanic

All tests are made using **gear**, not abstract skills. Every weapon, tool, or system has a **Skill Rating** and a **Malfunction Rating**.

1. **Build the Dice Pool**  
   - Roll a number of **d6 = Attribute + Gear Skill Rating**.  
   - Minimum: 1 die is always rolled.  

2. **Count Successes**  
   - Each roll of **5 or 6 = 1 success**.  
   - **1 success** = task completed (or 1 point of damage).  
   - More successes = stronger outcome, faster completion, or additional damage.  

3. **Weapons & Damage**  
   - Each success = 1 damage (unless weapon says otherwise).  
   - Targets reduce incoming damage by armor.  

4. **Task HP**  
   - Some challenges have HP that must be reduced to 0 (e.g. hacking a computer, cutting through a bulkhead, repairing a reactor).  
   - Each success rolled reduces the Task HP by 1.  
   - Each roll represents about one round of time under pressure.  

5. **Malfunctions**  
   - Each item has a **Malfunction Rating (MR)**.  
   - If you roll that many **1s** in a single test, a malfunction occurs.  
   - If you roll fewer dice than the MR, a malfunction only occurs if **all dice are 1s**.  
   - Malfunctions occur even if the test succeeds.  
   - Roll on the relevant **Malfunction Table**.  

---

## Carrying Capacity

Carry up to **Might + 8 items**.
- Exceeding this adds +2 dice difficulty (reduce successes by 1 for each test).
- Cannot exceed double capacity.

---

## Hit Points (HP)

- Start with **Grit + d8** HP (minimum 1).
- At **0 HP**: you are **Broken**.
- At negative HP: dead — unless your armour, nanites, or AI keep you going.

**Broken (d4):**

1. Unconscious for d4 rounds, AI takes partial control.  
2. Crippled (lose arm/eye/leg), AI keeps you functional.  
3. Bleeding out: death in d2 hours unless treated; nanites slow the process.  
4. Decapitated — but your suit keeps fighting until help arrives.  

---

## Rank

Ranks measure your experience and seniority within **HULLBREACH**.  
They unlock access to better equipment and privileges on the battlefield.

- **Trooper (Rank 1)** — Standard recruits. Access to Tier-1 gear.  
- **Specialist (Rank 2)** — Trusted operators. Access to Tier-1 and Tier-2 gear.  
- **Sergeant (Rank 3)** — Veteran leaders. Access to Tier-1 through Tier-3 gear.  
- **Lieutenant (Rank 4)** — Elite marines. Access to all four gear tiers.  

### Gear Tiers (Placeholder)

Gear is divided into four tiers. Each Rank unlocks higher tiers, with the most advanced weapons and equipment restricted to veterans. (Gear lists to come.)

### Promotion (Placeholder)

After completing missions, marines may be promoted to higher ranks. The process for promotion will be detailed later.

---

## Fire Modes

- **Full Auto** — Add +2 SR to the attack. Must reload immediately after firing.  
- **Burst** — May split damage across multiple targets in a 120° arc in the same zone.  
- **Suppression** — Targeted enemies’ movement is halved.  
- **Full Suppression** — Targets are pinned; cannot move this round. Requires reload afterwards.  

---

## Weapon Traits

- **Unreliable** — In Burst or Suppression, MR worsens by –1.  
- **Armor-Piercing** — Ignores 1 tier of armor (or all armor for advanced/prototype weapons).  
- **Shredding** — Targets struck without armor must make a morale check.  
- **Tracer** — Allies firing at the same target this round gain +1 die.  
- **Brutal** — On a crit (multiple 6s), deal +1 damage beyond normal.  
- **Stable Mount** — If braced (mounted, prone, bipod), gain +1 SR.  
- **Silent** — Does not trigger automatic Reaction checks.  
- **Overheat** — Cannot fire in Full Auto two turns in a row without a malfunction check.  

---

## Reloading

Reloading is a tense, risky process:

- **Takes an action.**  
- Make a **Reflex test using the weapon’s Skill Rating**.  
- You must roll a number of successes equal to the weapon’s **Reload Rating**.  
- If you succeed, the weapon is reloaded.  
- If you fail, the reload is incomplete, but progress is kept (Reload HP).  
- Some gear makes this process easier (see Reload Gear).

## Projectile Weapon Malfunctions

When a projectile weapon malfunctions, roll on the following table:

| d6 | Malfunction |
|----|-------------|
| 1   | **Accidental Ammo Ejection.** Mag or shells spill out. Weapon is empty and must be reloaded. |
| 2   | **Jam (2).** Weapon locks. Requires a **Tech test using the weapon’s SR**, needing **2 successes** to clear. Until cleared, weapon cannot fire. |
| 3   | **Stuck on Full Auto.** Weapon goes wild, spraying uncontrollably. Requires a **Tech test (3 successes)** to repair. If failed, weapon becomes **Jam (3)** until cleared. |
| 4   | **Accidental Discharge.** Weapon fires into a random friendly in the same zone (ally must roll Reflex to avoid). |
| 5   | **Burst Pipe.** The shot ruptures old ship infrastructure. Roll on the Environmental Hazards Sub-Table. |
| 6   | **Barrel Rupture.** Weapon explodes. It is destroyed. Holder takes **d3 damage**. |

### Clearing Jams
- Clearing a jam always requires a **Tech test with the weapon’s SR**.  
- The number in parentheses = **successes needed**.  
- While jammed, the weapon cannot fire.  

---

### Environmental Hazards Sub-Table (d6)

| d6 | Hazard |
|----|--------|
| 1–2 | **Steam Vent.** Scalding steam fills the zone. Everyone takes **1 damage** unless in sealed armor. Visibility reduced until end of round. |
| 3–4 | **Toxic Gas.** Corrosive fumes spread. Anyone without respirators or sealed armor must succeed a **Grit test (2 successes)** or take **d2 damage**. |
| 5   | **Acid Spray.** Pipes burst, spraying acid. Everyone in zone takes **d3 damage** and armor degrades 1 tier. |
| 6   | **Vacuum Breach.** Hull tears open slightly. Everyone must pass a **Reflex test (2 successes)** or be pulled into cover/ground; unanchored gear may be lost. |

## Melee Weapon Malfunctions

When a melee weapon (chainsword, power axe, etc.) malfunctions, roll on this table:

| d6 | Malfunction |
|----|-------------|
| 1   | **Slipped Grip.** You fumble the weapon. Costs 1 action to recover. |

---

---

## Explosives & Grenades (Placeholder)

Marines deploy a variety of grenades and demolitions:  
- Frag grenades, incendiaries, stun grenades.  
- Satchel charges and anti-armor rockets.  

Explosives have:  
- **Blast Radius** (zones).  
- **Damage dice** applied to all in zone.  
- **Malfunctions** (dud, misfire, dropped grenade, premature detonation).  

---

## Panic & Rising Tension (Placeholder)

Marines track **Panic Points (PP)** like hit points. Panic rises when:  
- Encountering horrors.  
- Squadmates die.  
- False scanner blips.  

At max Panic, marines break: flee, freeze, scream, or snap.  
- **Rally actions** (leadership, SOPMODs, combat drugs) reduce Panic.  

---

## Combat Drugs (Placeholder)

Combat stims enhance performance at a cost.  
- **Adrenastim**: boost Reflex, cause HP loss after.  
- **Pain-X**: ignore wound penalties, but collapse after.  
- **Focusin**: boost Tech, but induce paranoia.  
- **Regen Patch**: heal HP, but risk mutation.  

Each drug has:  
- **Boost Effect.**  
- **Crash Effect.**  
- **Overdose/Malfunction chance.**  

---

## SOPMOD Modules (Placeholder)

**Standard Operating Procedure Modules (SOPMODs):**  
AI-driven computer modules installed in the suit. Provide “skills on a stick.”  

Examples:  
- **Negotiation SOPMOD** — for NPC interactions.  
- **Interrogation SOPMOD** — bonus for extracting info.  
- **Xenology SOPMOD** — knowledge of alien biology.  
- **Command SOPMOD** — improves Rally actions and Panic reduction.  

---

## Initiative System (Placeholder)

At start of round:  
- Everyone rolls **Reflex + d6** = Initiative.  
- Combatants act in descending order.  
- After acting, subtract –4.  
- If still >0, act again.  
- Repeat until all ≤0.  

This creates dynamic rounds where faster marines act more often.  

---

## Surprise (Placeholder)

Surprise attacks:  
- Defenders cannot act during first cycle.  
- Surprise always triggers Panic checks.  
- Scanners and stealth interact heavily here.  

---

## Scanners & Blips (Placeholder)

Scanners detect “blips.” Each may be:  
- A real enemy.  
- A ghost image.  
- Environmental noise.  

Operators spend actions to interpret blips.  

Scanner Malfunctions:  
- False positives.  
- Ghost echoes.  
- Enemies appear in wrong zones.  

---

## Stealth (Placeholder)

Stealth uses **Stealth Points (SP)** like hit points.  
- A successful stealth roll = SP gained.  
- Detection attempts reduce SP.  
- At SP 0 = detected.  

Rules:  
- Firing ranged weapons ends stealth immediately.  
- Melee (silent) weapons do not.  
- Stealth gear provides limited uses per mission (battery cycles).  

---

## Test Difficulty Levels (Placeholder)

When making a test (Attribute + Gear SR dice pool):  
- GM sets a **Difficulty Rating (DR)** = number of **successes required**.  

Suggested levels:  
- **Trivial (1 success)** — automatic with proper gear.  
- **Routine (2 successes)** — expected field tasks.  
- **Hard (3 successes)** — stressful or contested situations.  
- **Extreme (4+ successes)** — rare, high-risk feats.  

---

## Personality Flaws (Placeholder)

Every marine has a **personality flaw** — a glitch in their psyche or conditioning.  

Examples:  
- Overconfidence.  
- Paranoia.  
- Compulsive violence.  
- Obsession with loot.  
- Fatalism.  

(Flaw table to be created.)  

---

## Panicked Action Table (Placeholder)

When Panic Points max out, roll on the **Panicked Action Table**.  

Examples:  
- Freeze in place.  
- Flee blindly into another zone.  
- Fire weapon wildly (friendly fire risk).  
- Drop gear and scream.  
- Berserk charge.  

---

## Exploring Derelicts (Placeholder)

Missions revolve around exploring derelict spacecraft in the **graveyard zone**.  

Key interactive elements:  
- **Doors** — locked, welded, jammed. Require breaching, hacking, or explosives.  
- **Computers** — may hold intel, control turrets, or be corrupted by alien code.  
- **Bulkheads & Hazards** — collapsed corridors, breached hulls, radiation zones.  
- **Environmental Events** — power surges, decompressions, shifting wreckage.  

Rules will give these elements **Task HP, malfunctions, and risks**.  

---

## Setting (Draft)

The marines are survivors of the **HULLBREACH Incident**.  
- Their mothership, the *Oath of Iron*, was lost in the **Graveyard**, a vast orbital field of wrecked warships, colony craft, and alien hulks.  
- The Graveyard is a frontier where **multiple alien factions** lurk:  
  - Hive predators.  
  - Rogue AI war machines.  
  - Parasitic infestations.  
  - Opportunistic scavengers.  
- The marines’ objective: **salvage, survival, and containment**.  

The *Oath of Iron* still drifts somewhere in the Graveyard — damaged, cut off, crew scattered. Marines launch missions into derelicts using strike pods, hoping to regroup and survive.  

---

## Blips (Placeholder)

**Blips** = the alien horrors and threats of the Graveyard.  
- Initially appear as **scanner contacts**.  
- Could be:  
  - Swarms of xenos.  
  - Rogue AI drones.  
  - Psychic predators.  
  - Rival scavengers or marines.  

Blips will have:  
- **HP, Armor, Attack Dice, Panic/Morale ratings.**  
- Malfunction-like “instinct” tables.  

---

## Introductory Scenario (Placeholder)

**Mission 1: The Lost Beacon**  
- The squad is dispatched to investigate a distress signal from a derelict frigate.  
- Objectives:  
  - Secure the bridge.  
  - Recover the black box.  
  - Survive extraction.  
- Hazards:  
  - Jammed doors, flickering power, false scanner blips.  
  - First contact with alien Blips.  
  - Environmental collapse.  

Scenario will introduce:  
- Basic tests (gear use, DRs).  
- Combat (projectiles, melee, malfunctions).  
- Panic & Rally system.  
- First taste of wounds, replacement, and paranoia.# HULLBREACH

## Design Prompt

HULLBREACH is a rules-light roleplaying game inspired by **MÖRK BORG** and **Cepheus Engine**, but reskinned for a sci-fi setting:  
Players take the role of **heavily armoured, bioengineered space marines** exploring derelict ships in a **spaceship graveyard**, battling alien horrors.

Core themes:

- **Tense exploration** of claustrophobic starship corridors.
- **Resource management** (ammo, gear, supplies, power cells).
- **Risk/reward** (push deeper for better salvage, at higher danger).
- **Over-the-top violence** with heavy weapons, flamers, grenades, chainblades.
- **Malfunctions** that are as funny as they are dangerous.
- **Marines and their power armour** can survive terrible wounds through nanites, cybernetics, and onboard AIs.
- **Gear-driven progression**: equipment defines actions; carrying capacity & Rank limit choices.

The game must remain **rules-light**: few mechanics, lots of dice rolled, quick but brutal combat and comedy.

---

## Ideas to Implement

- **Malfunction tables by gear type** (projectile, melee, special weapons, utility gear, armor systems).  
- **Medical treatments**: replacement limbs, organs, and even heads (cybernetic or vat-grown).  
- **Advantages and flaws** tied to replacement parts, with better options at higher Rank.  
- **Onboard AI control** when a marine is unconscious (reduced capability but not out of play).  
- **Task HP system** for hacking, cutting, and repairs under fire.  
- **Tiers of Gear** tied to Rank progression.  
- **Promotion system** for advancing Rank.  
- **Combat Zones & Movement mechanics** — revisit to refine tactical depth.  
- **Explosives & Grenades system.**  
- **Panic/Tension tracker system.**  
- **Combat Drugs system.**  
- **SOPMODs for social/knowledge skills.**  
- **Expanded Initiative system.**  
- **Surprise rules.**  
- **Scanner rules + malfunction table.**  
- **Expanded Stealth rules.**  
- **Panicked Action Table.**  
- **Exploration system for derelicts (doors, bulkheads, hazards).**  
- **Blips (alien enemies) bestiary.**  
- **Introductory Scenario.**

## Character Creation

### Generate Attributes & Starting Rank

Each character has four attributes (range –3 to +3). Roll **1d6** to see how many points you can spend **and to determine your starting Rank**.

| d6  | Points   | Starting Rank        |
|-----|----------|----------------------|
| 1–2 | 4 points | Specialist (Rank 2)  |
| 3–5 | 5 points | Trooper (Rank 1)     |
| 6   | 6 points | Trooper (Rank 1)     |

The attributes are as follows:

| Attribute  | Description                                |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Reflex** | Dodging, aiming, piloting                  |
| **Tech**   | Hacking, sensors, demolitions, interfacing |
| **Might**  | Melee, breaching, raw strength             |
| **Grit**   | Endurance, survival, pain threshold        |

The cost for assigning points is as follows:
 
| Modifier | Cost        |
|----------|-------------|
| –3       | –3 (refund) |
| –2       | –2 (refund) |
| –1       | –1 (refund) |
| 0        | Free        |
| +1       | 1           |
| +2       | 3           |
| +3       | 5           |

No stat may start higher than +3 or lower than –3.

### Roll Hit Points

Base HP now comes from your **armour model** (see Armour section), plus your **Grit** score.  

### Choose Armour

Select one of the available **Armour Models**. This defines your starting **Base HP, Carry Capacity, Movement, Damage Reduction, Wound Threshold, and Attribute bonuses**.  

### Choose Gear

   - Take basic survival kit (rations, oxygen, comms).
   - Roll or pick starting weapons, armor, and tools (see Gear section).
   - You may only carry items up to your **Armour’s Carry Capacity** without penalty.

### Define Your Marine

   - Give a name, callsign, or designation.
   - Your starting **Rank** is determined above. Higher Ranks will be earned through promotion.
   - Optionally, roll on background/flaw tables (to be added).

Then you’re ready for your first mission.

---

## Armour

*(Armour table with Base HP, DRR, WT, Move DR — unchanged from last draft)*

### Movement Check

- To move **1 zone**, make a **Reflex test vs your armour’s Move DR**.  
- Each **success = 1 zone moved** (max 2 zones per action).  
- **Failure = no movement** — you stumble, snag, or your armour slows you.  
- **Critical (3+ successes):** move 3 zones in a burst of speed.  
- **Complication (all 1s):** your armour makes a loud clang, vents sparks, or trips — roll on the Noise/Attention Table (to be written).  

---

## 💥 Damage & Wounds

- **Damage** reduces your armour’s **HP** after applying Damage Reduction (DRR).  
- At **0 HP**, your **suit is destroyed** — it no longer provides DRR or movement bonuses, but you may fight on if you survive wounds.  
- **Wound Threshold (WT):** Any single attack that deals ≥ WT damage causes a **Wound** to the marine inside the armour.  
- Wounds bypass armour and affect the **body** (limbs, organs, senses).  

---

## ⚡ Wounds Table (d20)

Whenever a Wound is inflicted, roll d20. Effects stack.  

| d20 | Wound |
|-----|-------|
| 1   | **Bruised Ribs.** Wind knocked out. –1 Reflex until end of mission. |
| 2   | **Fractured Hand.** Drop whatever you’re holding. Using 2H weapons adds +1 DR to all rolls. |
| 3   | **Shattered Foot.** Movement hobbled. Move DR +2. |
| 4   | **Eye Trauma.** Vision blurred or one eye lost. –1 die on ranged attacks. |
| 5   | **Ear Rupture.** Deaf on one side. Surprise attacks from that flank gain +1 die. |
| 6   | **Broken Arm.** Can’t use that arm. Drop items, 2H weapons impossible. |
| 7   | **Shoulder Dislocation.** –1 Might until repaired. |
| 8   | **Gut Puncture.** Bleeding internally. Take d3 Grit damage immediately. |
| 9   | **Collapsed Lung.** Breathing assisted by suit. –1 Grit until cybernetic/vat replacement. |
| 10  | **Cracked Spine.** Neural feedback. –1 Tech and Reflex. |
| 11  | **Severed Hand.** Lose hand; can’t use 2H gear. Must be replaced. |
| 12  | **Crushed Leg.** Can’t sprint. Move limited to 1 zone max. |
| 13  | **Severed Arm.** –2 Might. All gear in that hand lost. |
| 14  | **Severed Leg.** Move DR increases by +4, sprinting impossible. |
| 15  | **Severe Internal Trauma.** Suit’s nanites keep you alive, but you take d6 Grit damage. |
| 16  | **Organ Loss.** Kidney, spleen, liver, or equivalent. Immediate med treatment required or die at mission end. |
| 17  | **Massive Head Trauma.** Suit AI takes partial control. –2 Reflex and Tech until replaced (cybernetic or vat head). |
| 18  | **Catastrophic Bleed.** Artery ruptured. Lose d3 HP at end of each round until treated. |
| 19  | **Decapitation (Partial).** Head severed or crushed — but suit AI puppets the body for d3 rounds. Afterwards: dead without replacement. |
| 20  | **Fatal Core Damage.** Heart or brain destroyed. Nanites keep you alive for 1 round. If not treated immediately (Med Task HP 3), you die. |

---

## 🧬 Medical Treatment

Marines of the HULLBREACH Corps are designed to survive injuries that would instantly kill ordinary humans. Stabilizing nanites, automated suit systems, and battlefield medicine can keep them alive — but wounds often require cybernetics or vat-grown replacements.  

### Stabilization (in the field)

- **Broken Marines** or those suffering severe **Wounds** must be stabilized to avoid death.  
- Stabilization requires appropriate **Medical Gear** (Medi-Pack, Field Surgery Kit, Nanite Injector, etc.).  
- Each item has a **Task HP** cost depending on severity:  
  - Minor Wound: Task HP 1  
  - Major Wound (limb loss, organ failure): Task HP 2  
  - Critical Wound (head trauma, decapitation, heart/lung): Task HP 3+  
- A **Tech test** is rolled with the medical gear’s **SR**. Each success reduces Task HP by 1.  

If Task HP is not reduced to 0 before the mission ends, the marine dies.

---

### Replacement & Recovery (between missions)

Destroyed or crippled body parts can be replaced with **cybernetics** or **vat-grown organs/limbs**.  
Higher Rank marines have access to higher-quality replacements.  

| Replacement Type   | Effect |
|--------------------|--------|
| **Basic Cybernetic** | Restores lost function, but roll on Flaw Table. |
| **Advanced Cybernetic** | Restores function and grants a minor bonus (+1 die to relevant tests). |
| **Vat-Grown Clone Part** | Identical replacement, no bonuses or flaws. Expensive. |
| **Experimental Graft** | Restores function and grants unique perk (infrared eye, servo arm, toxin-filter lung) — but unstable. Roll on Experimental Graft Table. |

---

### Post-Mission Recovery

At the end of a mission:  
- Roll **d6 for each Wound** you sustained.  
  - On 1–3: it requires replacement (cybernetic or vat).  
  - On 4–6: nanites + stasis pods repaired it. You recover without surgery.  
- HP is restored fully after downtime, but attribute penalties from lost parts remain until treated.  

---

### Death & Resurrection (optional rule)

Even death is not always the end. With enough **resources and Rank**, marines may be revived through:  
- **Cerebral Core Backup** (upload into a cloned or cybernetic body).  
- **Nanite Reanimation** (return to action, but permanently Flawed).  
- **AI Puppetry** (the marine’s suit AI runs their body indefinitely… personality optional).  

Each option carries heavy **costs and corruption risks**.  

---

## ⚡ Cybernetic Flaw Table (d20)

Roll whenever you receive a **basic cybernetic replacement** (limb, organ, sensory system). Higher-rank or advanced replacements may ignore this table.  

| d20 | Flaw |
|-----|------|
| 1   | **Glitch-Twitch.** Involuntary spasms. –1 die to Reflex tests requiring precision. |
| 2   | **Cold Grip.** Prosthetic hand lacks fine control. +1 DR to delicate tasks. |
| 3   | **Feedback Loop.** Occasional shocks. Take 1 damage after rolling a natural 1. |
| 4   | **Uncalibrated Optics.** Depth perception off. –1 die on ranged attacks. |
| 5   | **Phantom Pain.** Old nerves scream. Lose 1 action on a roll of triple 1s. |
| 6   | **Noise Bleed.** Audio implant picks up static. Surprise attacks gain +1 die against you. |
| 7   | **Drain Hog.** Cybernetics siphon suit power. Reduce Carry Capacity by –2. |
| 8   | **Overheats.** Implant runs hot. On long missions, take d2 damage unless cooled. |
| 9   | **Patchwork Code.** Tech tests suffer +1 DR when using hacking gear. |
| 10  | **Magnet Weakness.** Strong fields mess with you. On malfunction nearby, drop items in hand. |
| 11  | **Servo Lag.** Movements delayed. Initiative rolls suffer –1. |
| 12  | **Uncanny Face.** Vat-grown or synthetic features creep others out. NPC Reactions at –2. |
| 13  | **Nanite Addiction.** You require an injector every mission or lose 1 Grit. |
| 14  | **Horrible Scar Tissue.** –1 HP permanently. Looks metal as hell. |
| 15  | **AI Ghost.** Replacement part whispers in your dreams. Once per mission, it acts on its own. |
| 16  | **Obvious Mod.** Everyone knows you’re patched up. Enemies prioritize you in combat. |
| 17  | **Paranoid Subroutines.** You mistrust allies. Reaction rolls with squadmates are one step worse. |

## ⚡ Experimental Graft Table (d12)

Roll when a marine receives an unstable, prototype graft instead of a standard replacement. Each graft gives a **perk AND a flaw**.  

| d12 | Graft |
|-----|-------|
| 1 | **Infrared Eye.** See in darkness and through smoke. Flaw: bright lights blind you (–2 dice for 1 round). |
| 2 | **Servo Arm.** +1 Might and can crush steel. Flaw: unpredictable twitch — roll d6 each mission; on 1, it attacks nearest object/ally once. |
| 3 | **Toxin Filter Lung.** Immune to gas/poison. Flaw: requires daily nanite infusion or lose 1 Grit. |
| 4 | **Adrenal Node.** Once per mission, add +2 dice to any roll. Flaw: after use, lose d3 HP from burnout. |
| 5 | **Dermal Plating.** Gain +1 DRR. Flaw: skin stiff and pale. Stealth rolls at –1 die. |
| 6 | **Ossified Fist.** Can punch for Dmg 2, Armor-Piercing. Flaw: hand too stiff for fine tasks. Cannot use gear requiring SR > 1. |
| 7 | **Neural Overclocker.** +1 Tech. Flaw: on natural 1, take d3 damage from seizures. |
| 8 | **Spider Limbs.** Extra mechanical arms. Can wield 3rd weapon/tool. Flaw: +1 slot permanently used by the limbs. |
| 9 | **Tail-Spike.** Natural melee weapon (Dmg 2, Brutal). Flaw: +1 slot; enemies always notice you first. |
| 10 | **Vascular Nanite Mesh.** Once per mission, ignore a Wound result. Flaw: permanent corruption risk — roll d20 each mission; on 1, nanites revolt (take d6 damage). |
| 11 | **Overclocked Heart.** Initiative always succeeds in your favor. Flaw: after combat, roll d6; on 1, suffer heart failure (Broken). |
| 12 | **Hive Interface.** Can control up to 2 drones as if they were your own limbs. Flaw: alien whispers creep in — once per mission, GM may force you to act against squad goals for 1 round. |

## Core Rules

### Resolution Mechanic

All tests are made using **gear**, not abstract skills. Every weapon, tool, or system has a **Skill Rating** and a **Malfunction Rating**.

1. **Build the Dice Pool**  
   - Roll a number of **d6 = Attribute + Gear Skill Rating**.  
   - Minimum: 1 die is always rolled.  

2. **Count Successes**  
   - Each roll of **5 or 6 = 1 success**.  
   - **1 success** = task completed (or 1 point of damage).  
   - More successes = stronger outcome, faster completion, or additional damage.  

3. **Weapons & Damage**  
   - Each success = 1 damage (unless weapon says otherwise).  
   - Targets reduce incoming damage by armor.  

4. **Task HP**  
   - Some challenges have HP that must be reduced to 0 (e.g. hacking a computer, cutting through a bulkhead, repairing a reactor).  
   - Each success rolled reduces the Task HP by 1.  
   - Each roll represents about one round of time under pressure.  

5. **Malfunctions**  
   - Each item has a **Malfunction Rating (MR)**.  
   - If you roll that many **1s** in a single test, a malfunction occurs.  
   - If you roll fewer dice than the MR, a malfunction only occurs if **all dice are 1s**.  
   - Malfunctions occur even if the test succeeds.  
   - Roll on the relevant **Malfunction Table**.  

---

## Carrying Capacity

Carry up to **Might + 8 items**.
- Exceeding this adds +2 dice difficulty (reduce successes by 1 for each test).
- Cannot exceed double capacity.

---

## Hit Points (HP)

- Start with **Grit + d8** HP (minimum 1).
- At **0 HP**: you are **Broken**.
- At negative HP: dead — unless your armour, nanites, or AI keep you going.

**Broken (d4):**

1. Unconscious for d4 rounds, AI takes partial control.  
2. Crippled (lose arm/eye/leg), AI keeps you functional.  
3. Bleeding out: death in d2 hours unless treated; nanites slow the process.  
4. Decapitated — but your suit keeps fighting until help arrives.  

---

## Rank

Ranks measure your experience and seniority within **HULLBREACH**.  
They unlock access to better equipment and privileges on the battlefield.

- **Trooper (Rank 1)** — Standard recruits. Access to Tier-1 gear.  
- **Specialist (Rank 2)** — Trusted operators. Access to Tier-1 and Tier-2 gear.  
- **Sergeant (Rank 3)** — Veteran leaders. Access to Tier-1 through Tier-3 gear.  
- **Lieutenant (Rank 4)** — Elite marines. Access to all four gear tiers.  

### Gear Tiers (Placeholder)

Gear is divided into four tiers. Each Rank unlocks higher tiers, with the most advanced weapons and equipment restricted to veterans. (Gear lists to come.)

### Promotion (Placeholder)

After completing missions, marines may be promoted to higher ranks. The process for promotion will be detailed later.

---

## Fire Modes

- **Full Auto** — Add +2 SR to the attack. Must reload immediately after firing.  
- **Burst** — May split damage across multiple targets in a 120° arc in the same zone.  
- **Suppression** — Targeted enemies’ movement is halved.  
- **Full Suppression** — Targets are pinned; cannot move this round. Requires reload afterwards.  

---

## Weapon Traits

- **Unreliable** — In Burst or Suppression, MR worsens by –1.  
- **Armor-Piercing** — Ignores 1 tier of armor (or all armor for advanced/prototype weapons).  
- **Shredding** — Targets struck without armor must make a morale check.  
- **Tracer** — Allies firing at the same target this round gain +1 die.  
- **Brutal** — On a crit (multiple 6s), deal +1 damage beyond normal.  
- **Stable Mount** — If braced (mounted, prone, bipod), gain +1 SR.  
- **Silent** — Does not trigger automatic Reaction checks.  
- **Overheat** — Cannot fire in Full Auto two turns in a row without a malfunction check.  

---

## Reloading

Reloading is a tense, risky process:

- **Takes an action.**  
- Make a **Reflex test using the weapon’s Skill Rating**.  
- You must roll a number of successes equal to the weapon’s **Reload Rating**.  
- If you succeed, the weapon is reloaded.  
- If you fail, the reload is incomplete, but progress is kept (Reload HP).  
- Some gear makes this process easier (see Reload Gear).

- If still >0, act again.  
- Repeat until all ≤0.  

This creates dynamic rounds where faster marines act more often.  

---

## Surprise (Placeholder)

Surprise attacks:  
- Defenders cannot act during first cycle.  
- Surprise always triggers Panic checks.  
- Scanners and stealth interact heavily here.  

---

## Scanners & Blips (Placeholder)

Scanners detect “blips.” Each may be:  
- A real enemy.  
- A ghost image.  
- Environmental noise.  

Operators spend actions to interpret blips.  

Scanner Malfunctions:  
- False positives.  
- Ghost echoes.  
- Enemies appear in wrong zones.  

---

## Stealth (Placeholder)

Stealth uses **Stealth Points (SP)** like hit points.  
- A successful stealth roll = SP gained.  
- Detection attempts reduce SP.  
- At SP 0 = detected.  

Rules:  
- Firing ranged weapons ends stealth immediately.  
- Melee (silent) weapons do not.  
- Stealth gear provides limited uses per mission (battery cycles).  

---

## Test Difficulty Levels (Placeholder)

When making a test (Attribute + Gear SR dice pool):  
- GM sets a **Difficulty Rating (DR)** = number of **successes required**.  

Suggested levels:  
- **Trivial (1 success)** — automatic with proper gear.  
- **Routine (2 successes)** — expected field tasks.  
- **Hard (3 successes)** — stressful or contested situations.  
- **Extreme (4+ successes)** — rare, high-risk feats.  

---

## Personality Flaws (Placeholder)

Every marine has a **personality flaw** — a glitch in their psyche or conditioning.  

Examples:  
- Overconfidence.  
- Paranoia.  
- Compulsive violence.  
- Obsession with loot.  
- Fatalism.  

(Flaw table to be created.)  

---

## Panicked Action Table (Placeholder)

When Panic Points max out, roll on the **Panicked Action Table**.  

Examples:  
- Freeze in place.  
- Flee blindly into another zone.  
- Fire weapon wildly (friendly fire risk).  
- Drop gear and scream.  
- Berserk charge.  

---

## Exploring Derelicts (Placeholder)

Missions revolve around exploring derelict spacecraft in the **graveyard zone**.  

Key interactive elements:  
- **Doors** — locked, welded, jammed. Require breaching, hacking, or explosives.  
- **Computers** — may hold intel, control turrets, or be corrupted by alien code.  
- **Bulkheads & Hazards** — collapsed corridors, breached hulls, radiation zones.  
- **Environmental Events** — power surges, decompressions, shifting wreckage.  

Rules will give these elements **Task HP, malfunctions, and risks**.  

---

## Setting (Draft)

The marines are survivors of the **HULLBREACH Incident**.  
- Their mothership, the *Oath of Iron*, was lost in the **Graveyard**, a vast orbital field of wrecked warships, colony craft, and alien hulks.  
- The Graveyard is a frontier where **multiple alien factions** lurk:  
  - Hive predators.  
  - Rogue AI war machines.  
  - Parasitic infestations.  
  - Opportunistic scavengers.  
- The marines’ objective: **salvage, survival, and containment**.  

The *Oath of Iron* still drifts somewhere in the Graveyard — damaged, cut off, crew scattered. Marines launch missions into derelicts using strike pods, hoping to regroup and survive.  

---

## Blips (Placeholder)

**Blips** = the alien horrors and threats of the Graveyard.  
- Initially appear as **scanner contacts**.  
- Could be:  
  - Swarms of xenos.  
  - Rogue AI drones.  
  - Psychic predators.  
  - Rival scavengers or marines.  

Blips will have:  
- **HP, Armor, Attack Dice, Panic/Morale ratings.**  
- Malfunction-like “instinct” tables.
