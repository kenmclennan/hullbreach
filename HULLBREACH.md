# HULLBREACH

## Design Prompt

You are designing a rules-light roleplaying game inspired by **MÖRK BORG** and **Cepheus Engine**, but reskinned for a sci-fi setting:
Players take the role of **heavily armoured space warriors** exploring derelict ships in a **spaceship graveyard**, battling alien horrors.

Core themes:

- **Tense exploration** of claustrophobic starship corridors.
- **Resource management** (ammo, gear, supplies, power cells).
- **Risk/reward** (push deeper for better salvage, at higher danger).
- **Over-the-top violence** with heavy weapons, flamers, grenades, chainblades.
- **Gear-driven progression**: equipment defines actions; carrying capacity & Rank limit choices.

The game must remain **rules-light**: few attributes, fast dice mechanics, quick but brutal combat.

## Character Creation

### Generate Attributes & Starting Rank

Each character has four attributes (range –3 to +3). Roll **1d6** to see how many points you can spend **and to determine your starting Rank**.

| d6  | Points   | Starting Rank |
|-----|----------|---------------|
| 1–2 | 4 points | Specialist (Rank 2) |
| 3–5 | 5 points | Trooper (Rank 1)    |
| 6   | 6 points | Trooper (Rank 1)    |

The attributes are as follows:

| Attribute  | Description                                |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Reflex** | Dodging, aiming, piloting                  |
| **Tech**   | Hacking, sensors, demolitions, interfacing |
| **Might**  | Melee, breaching, raw strength             |
| **Grit**   | Endurance, survival, pain threshold        |

The cost for assigning points is as follows:
 
| Modifier | Cost        |
|----------|-------------|
| –3       | –3 (refund) |
| –2       | –2 (refund) |
| –1       | –1 (refund) |
| 0        | Free        |
| +1       | 1           |
| +2       | 3           |
| +3       | 5           |

No stat may start higher than +3 or lower than –3.

### Roll Hit Points

Start with **Grit + d8** (minimum 1)

### Choose Gear

   - Take basic survival kit (rations, oxygen, comms).
   - Roll or pick starting weapons, armor, and tools (see Gear section).
   - You may only carry **Might + 8** items without penalty.

### Define Your Marine

   - Give a name, callsign, or designation.
   - Your starting **Rank** is determined above. Higher Ranks will be earned through promotion.
   - Optionally, roll on background/flaw tables (to be added).

Then you’re ready for your first mission.

## Core Rules

### Tests

Roll **d20 + attribute** vs a Difficulty Rating (DR). If total ≥ DR, you succeed.

| DR | Difficulty        |
|----|-------------------|
| 6  | trivial           |
| 8  | routine           |
| 10 | simple            |
| 12 | standard          |
| 14 | difficult         |
| 16 | extreme           |
| 18 | nearly impossible |

Creatures roll only a flat **d20 vs DR**.

### Carrying Capacity

Carry up to **Might + 8 items**.
- Exceeding this adds +2 DR to Reflex and Might tests.
- Cannot exceed double capacity.

### Hit Points (HP)

- Start with **Grit + d8** HP (minimum 1).
- At **0 HP**: you are **Broken**.
- At negative HP: dead.

**Broken (d4):**

1. Unconscious for d4 rounds, awaken with d4 HP.
2. Crippled (lose arm/eye/leg), awaken with d4 HP.
3. Bleeding out: death in d2 hours unless treated.
4. Dead.

### Combat

**Initiative (d6):**

- 1–3 = enemies act first.
- 4–6 = players act first.
- Optional: Reflex + d6 for individual order.

**Actions:**

- Melee Attack: Might vs DR12.
- Ranged Attack: Reflex vs DR12.
- Defence: Reflex vs DR12 (fail = enemy hits).

### Criticals & Fumbles

- **Critical (nat 20):** double damage; armor/protection degraded; free counterattack on defence.
- **Fumble (nat 1):** weapon jams/breaks/out of ammo; defence = double damage + armor degraded.

### Weapons & Ammo

Damage dice examples:

- Pistol d6
- SMG/Carbine 2d6 per burst (1 ammo die)
- Heavy Rifle d8
- Flamer 2d8 area (1 ammo die)
- Grenade 2d10 (consumed)
- Melee d6–d10

**Ammo Dice:** When firing, roll 1d6.

- On 1–2: reduce ammo by 1.
- At 0: weapon empty.

### Armor

- Light: –d2 damage.
- Medium: –d4 damage, +2 DR to Reflex tests.
- Heavy: –d6 damage, +4 DR to Reflex tests, +2 DR to Defence.
- Shield: –1 damage, or break to negate a hit.

Armor degrades one tier when damaged.

### Rest & Recovery

- Catch breath (short rest, stim): regain d4 HP.
- Full rest in safe zone: regain d6 HP.
- No rations/oxygen: no healing, lose d4 HP/day.
- Infected/poisoned: no healing, lose d6 HP/day.

---

## Reaction (2d6)

- 2–3: Attack immediately.
- 4–6: Hostile.
- 7–8: Indifferent.
- 9–10: Cautious/neutral.
- 11–12: Helpful.

---

## Morale

Enemies rarely fight to the death. Roll **2d6 vs Morale** when:

- Leader is killed.
- Half the group is gone.
- One has ⅓ HP left.

If roll > Morale:

- 1–3 flee.
- 4–6 surrender.

---

## Rank

Ranks measure your experience and seniority within **HULLBREACH**.  
They unlock access to better equipment and privileges on the battlefield.

- **Trooper (Rank 1)** — Standard recruits. Access to Tier-1 gear.  
- **Specialist (Rank 2)** — Trusted operators. Access to Tier-1 and Tier-2 gear.  
- **Sergeant (Rank 3)** — Veteran leaders. Access to Tier-1 through Tier-3 gear.  
- **Lieutenant (Rank 4)** — Elite marines. Access to all four gear tiers.  

### Gear Tiers (Placeholder)

Gear is divided into four tiers. Each Rank unlocks higher tiers, with the most advanced weapons and equipment restricted to veterans. (Gear lists to come.)

### Promotion (Placeholder)

After completing missions, marines may be promoted to higher ranks. The process for promotion will be detailed later.

---

## Advancement

At mission end:

- **HP:** Roll 6d10; if ≥ max HP, gain +d6.
- **Attributes:** Roll d6 vs each stat.  
  - If ≥ score, increase +1 (max +6).  
  - If lower, decrease –1 (min –3).
