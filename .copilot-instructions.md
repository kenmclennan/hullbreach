# HULLBREACH Development Instructions

## Game Overview

You are helping develop **HULLBREACH**, a rules-light sci-fi RPG about heavily armored space marines exploring derelict ships in a spaceship graveyard. The game is inspired by MÖRK BORG emphasizing:

- **Tense exploration** of claustrophobic starship corridors
- **Resource management** (ammo, gear, supplies, power cells)
- **Risk/reward mechanics** (push deeper for better salvage at higher danger)
- **Over-the-top violence** with heavy weapons and brutal combat
- **Equipment malfunctions** that are both dangerous and comedic
- **Cybernetic replacements** for lost body parts
- **Gear-driven progression** where equipment defines capabilities

## Core Design Principles

### Rules-Light Philosophy

- Keep mechanics simple and fast
- Favour narrative outcomes over complex calculations
- Everything revolves around **Attribute + Gear Skill Rating** dice pools
- Success = 5-6 on d6, malfunctions on rolling multiple 1s
- Embrace chaos and unexpected outcomes

### Gear-Centric System

- Characters have no abstract "skills" - everything comes from equipment
- Each piece of gear has **Skill Rating (SR)** and **Malfunction Rating (MR)**
- Better gear = higher SR, but often higher malfunction risk
- Gear is tiered (1-4) and locked behind **Rank** progression
- Equipment defines what characters can do, not character builds

### Visceral Combat & Consequences

- Combat is fast, brutal, and has lasting consequences
- **Wound system** creates permanent injuries requiring cybernetic/vat replacements
- **Malfunction tables** for all gear types create comedic chaos
- Marines can survive extreme trauma through nanites, AI control, and cybernetics
- Death isn't always permanent - resurrection through backup/AI is possible

## Key Game Systems to Understand

### Attributes (4 total, range -3 to +3)

- **Reflex**: Dodging, aiming, piloting
- **Tech**: Hacking, sensors, demolitions, interfacing
- **Might**: Melee, breaching, raw strength
- **Grit**: Endurance, survival, pain threshold

### Core Resolution

1. Roll dice = Attribute + Gear SR (minimum 1 die)
2. Count successes (5-6 on d6)
3. Check for malfunctions (rolling MR number of 1s)
4. Apply results and consequences

### Wound & Medical System

- Armour provides HP and Damage Reduction Rating (DRR)
- **Wound Threshold**: Single attacks ≥ WT bypass armor, cause wounds
- Wounds affect body parts, stack penalties, require medical intervention
- Field stabilization uses **Task HP** system
- Post-mission: cybernetic/vat replacements with potential flaws/perks

### Equipment Malfunctions

- Every gear type has unique malfunction tables
- Malfunctions create narrative complications, not just mechanical penalties
- Range from minor inconveniences to catastrophic explosions
- Often affect environment or allies, not just user

## Current Development Priorities

### Completed Systems

- Character creation and attributes
- Core resolution mechanics
- Extensive weapon systems (projectile, melee, special, utility)
- Wound tables and medical treatment
- Cybernetic replacement system with flaw/perk tables
- Malfunction tables for all weapon types

### Systems Needing Development (Priority Order)

1. **Armor systems** - Complete armor tables with stats
2. **Explosives & Grenades** - Blast mechanics, malfunction tables
3. **Panic/Tension system** - Stress mechanics, breaking points
4. **Initiative system** - Dynamic turn order mechanics
5. **Stealth & Scanner systems** - Detection, blips, false positives
6. **Combat Drugs** - Boost/crash mechanics, side effects
7. **SOPMOD modules** - AI skill systems
8. **Environmental hazards** - Derelict exploration rules
9. **Blips bestiary** - Alien enemy types and behaviors
10. **Promotion system** - Rank advancement mechanics

## Writing Style Guidelines

### Tone & Voice
- **Grimdark but not hopeless** - brutal but with gallows humor
- **Technical but accessible** - military jargon without overwhelming complexity
- **Visceral descriptions** - emphasize physical consequences and sensory details
- **Dark comedy** - malfunctions and failures should be funny as well as dangerous

### Mechanical Writing
- Always specify dice types and numbers clearly (d6, d20, 2d4, etc.)
- Use consistent terminology: SR (Skill Rating), MR (Malfunction Rating), WT (Wound Threshold)
- Include examples for complex mechanics
- Make tables scannable with clear headers and consistent formatting
- Reference other sections when mechanics interact

### Table Design
- Use consistent formatting across all tables
- Include range indicators (d6, d20, etc.) in headers
- Make entries evocative and narratively rich
- Balance mechanical effects with story implications
- Include edge cases and critical results

## Content Creation Guidelines

### When Creating New Gear
- Always include: Slots, SR, MR, Cost (in RP - Rank Points)
- Consider tier restrictions (Rank 1-4)
- Higher tiers = better performance but often more complex/risky
- Special abilities should be flavorful and mechanically distinct
- Include hands required, range (if applicable)

### When Creating Malfunction Tables
- 6 entries for most gear types, d20 for major systems
- Range from inconvenient (#1-2) to catastrophic (#6 or #20)
- Include friendly fire possibilities
- Consider environmental effects (steam, acid, sparks)
- Make failures memorable and story-worthy

### When Creating Wound/Medical Content
- Emphasize body horror but keep it gameable
- Include both mechanical penalties and narrative descriptions
- Consider how injuries affect gear use
- Balance permanent consequences with advancement opportunities
- Remember: marines are tough, but not invulnerable

### When Creating Enemy/Blip Content
- Start with scanner detection mechanics
- Include false positive possibilities
- Give creatures unique interaction with game systems
- Consider panic-inducing qualities
- Balance threat level with available gear tiers

## Technical Considerations

### Dice Probability
- 5-6 on d6 = 33% success rate per die
- Most routine tasks should need 2 successes
- Difficult tasks 3-4 successes
- Malfunction rates: MR 2 = common, MR 4 = rare

### Game Balance
- Higher Rank = access to better gear, not inherently more powerful
- Resource management through ammo, medical supplies, gear durability
- Risk/reward through deeper exploration vs. safer extraction
- Meaningful choices between gear loadouts

### Cross-System Integration
- Consider how new systems interact with existing mechanics
- Maintain consistent terminology and probability curves
- Ensure new content doesn't obsolete existing options
- Keep complexity manageable for table play

## When Expanding Placeholder Systems

Look for sections marked "(Placeholder)" and develop them following these patterns:
- **Mechanics**: Simple, fast resolution using existing dice mechanics
- **Tables**: Rich, evocative entries that drive narrative
- **Integration**: Connect to existing systems (wounds, malfunctions, gear)
- **Balance**: Risk/reward that creates meaningful decisions

Remember: HULLBREACH should feel like a blend of Aliens, Event Horizon, and Warhammer 40K - grimdark military sci-fi with equipment failures that are as dangerous as they are darkly amusing.
